Use a 6-page memo rather than a deck for a (board) meeting.

Here is the rough outline for the memo:

1. Top 3 things going well
2. Top 3 things to improve/watch
3. Main business/user KPI charts
4. 3-3 deep dive topics
5. At the end of each deep dive topic have open ended discussion questions
6. Appendix (pages 7+) - full of the more usual status
   updates that the board needs to be aware of.

Send it out 3 days before and everyone reads in advance.

Spend all the time in the meeting focused on the most important discussions.

Unexpected benefit: 
I am a lot more proud of the board memo than I was 
of any of our board decks. The memo is well thought out 
and structured and explains all our thoughts 
without needing to be talked over.
